* Currently if a large image is displayed, and an image that is not as wide is faded in, the new image will render on top of the old, and then fade in. This is not ideal. The old image should fade out while the new image fades in. This is a bit more complicated, but I think it's worth it. Can do this by rendering the new image on a texture that is always the size of the screen, and then fading that texture in. Then, when the new image is fully faded in, the old will be faded out as a result.
